            <p className="text-center mx-8 my-4">StudyDuels is an app to help you study by going against your friends and seeing who can study better. All you have to do is <span className="italic font-medium">create a room, share the join link with your friend, and start studying</span>. We encourage both of you to be on a call while playing a game. We also encourage you to bet a little something on the game, though that's not necessary</p>
            <p className="text-center mx-8 my-4"><span className="font-bold">Note:</span> StudyDuel is a fast-paced app. The study times aren't meant to be much longer than 15 minutes. Thus, you will see much better results if you choose more specific topics.</p>
